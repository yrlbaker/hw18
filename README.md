# Instruction Manual for Testnet Blockchain
(draft)

Hello Team,

Thank you for taking the time to use this testnet blockchain. Whatever part of the manual you are on, please note the following: 

- Your public address is just that, public. Please share with whomever needs it. 
- Likewise, any key labeled "secret", or "private", must not be shared with anyone. No exceptions. To show these secret or private keys is to give the keys to your home or car to someone else. They know have possession of it.
- Remember to keep your key file and passwords in a secure location. Without these things, you will be unable to open certain portions of your account.
- Close any unncessary brwoser screens or applications on your computer. Some of the actions you will do will cause a heavy load on your system, and any other unused but open programs may cause it to crash.
